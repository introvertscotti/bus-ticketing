So, Welcome to this project. I guarantee you 
this README file is going to be one of the most ridiculous 
things you'll ever read on the internet.

I know very little about visually formatting Markdown files
so bear with me, this will be like plain text.

Like most of my projects, this too was just an expression 
of my thoughts on that particular day. I really didnt 
mean to build it completely to the finish. I was just having fun.

I wanted to build something people can use to book local, intercity buses
instead of going to bus offices. I know it probably sounds mundane and basic
but it's a huge pain in the ass what happens in my city.

A user will be given a downloadable boarding pass. They can print 
or get the softcopy scanned, either way.

I know i have oversimplified the goings on of the whole booking 
process, but wtf, who cares. You get the gist.

I'll be updating it from time to time, with whatever ideas I 
get in my head to implement in it.

Feel free to download it, fork it, contribute to it anytime, 
with or without credit, dont worry, who gives a fuck.
